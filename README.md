### Shared library for Cyberpunk 2077 mods

A library with some core utilities for making Cyberpunk 2077 mods using [RED4ext](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK), along with various reverse engineered data. Mostly put together for my personal use.

Credits to [psiberx](https://github.com/psiberx), a lot of this library is basically ripped off from him.
